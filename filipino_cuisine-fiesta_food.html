	 For festive occasions, people band together and prepare more sophisticated dishes. Tables are often laden with expensive and labor-intensive treats 
	 requiring hours of preparation. In Filipino celebrations, lechón (also spelled litson) serves as the centerpiece of the dinner table. It is usually a 
	 whole roasted pig, but suckling pigs (lechonillo, or lechon de leche) or cattle calves (lechongbaka) can also be prepared in place of the popular adult 
	 pig. It is typically served with lechon sauce. Other dishes include hamonado (honey-cured beef, pork or chicken), relleno (stuffed chicken or milkfish), 
	 mechado,afritada, caldereta, puchero, paella, menudo, morcon, embutido (referring to a meatloaf dish, not a sausage as understood elsewhere), suman (a 
	 savory rice and coconut milk concoction steamed in leaves such as banana), and pancit canton. The table may also be have various sweets and pastries such 
	 as leche flan, ube, sapin-sapin, sorbetes (ice creams), totong (a rice, coconut milk and mongo bean pudding), ginataan (a coconut milk pudding with 
	 various root vegetables and tapioca pearls), and gulaman (an agar jello-like ingredient or dessert).
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Christmas Eve, known as Noche Buena, is the most important feast. During this evening, the star of the table is the Christmas ham and Edam cheese(queso 
	 de bola). Supermarkets are laden with these treats during the Christmas season and are popular giveaways by Filipino companies in addition to red wine, 
	 brandy, groceries, or pastries. Available mostly during the Christmas season and sold in front of churches along with bibingka, putobumbongis a purple 
	 yam-flavored puto.

	 More common at celebrations than in everyday home meals, lumpiangsariwa, sometimes referred to as fresh lumpia, is a fresh spring roll that consists of a 
	 soft crepe wrapped around a filling that can include strips of kamote (sweet potato), singkamas (jicama), bean sprouts, green beans, cabbage, carrots and 
	 meat (often pork). It can be served warm or cold and typically with a sweet peanut and garlic sauce. Ukoy is shredded papaya combined with small shrimp 
	 (and occasionally bean sprouts) and fried to make shrimp patties. It is often eaten with vinegar seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper. Both 
	 lumpiangsariwa and ukoy are often accompanied together in Filipino parties. Lumpiangsariwa has Chinese origins, having been derived from popiah.
