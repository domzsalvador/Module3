	 In a typical Filipino bakery, pandesal, monay and ensaymada are often sold. Pandesal comes from the Spanish pan de sal (literally, bread of salt), and is 
	 a ubiquitous breakfast fare, normally eaten with (and sometimes even dipped in) coffee. It typically takes the form of a bread roll, and is usually baked 
	 covered in bread crumbs. Contrary to what its name implies, pandesal is not particularly salty as very little salt is used in baking it. Monay is a firmer 
	 slightly denser heavier bread. Ensaymada, from the Spanish ensaimada, is a pastry made using butter and often topped with sugar and shredded cheese that 
	 is especially popular during Christmas. It is sometimes made with fillings such as ube (purple yam) and macapuno (a variety of coconut the meat of which 
	 is often cut into strings, sweetened, preserved, and served in desserts). Also commonly sold in Filipino bakeries is pan de coco, a sweet roll filled with 
	 shredded coconut mixed with molasses. Putok, which literally means "explode", refers to a small, hard bread roll whose cratered surface is glazed with 
	 sugar. Kababayan is a small, sweet gong-shaped muffin that has a moist consistency. Spanish bread refers to a rolled pastry which looks like a croissant 
	 prior to being given a crescent shape, and has a filling consisting of sugar and butter.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 There are also rolls like pianono, which is a chiffon roll flavored with different fillings. Brazo de mercedes, a rolled cake or jelly roll, is made from 
	 a sheet of meringue rolled around a custard filling. Similar to the previous dessert, it takes on a layered presentation instead of being rolled and 
	 typically features caramelized sugar and nuts for sans rival. Silvañas are large, oval-shaped, cookie-sized desserts, with a thin meringue on either side 
	 of a buttercream filling and dusted with crumbed cookies. Not overly sweet, they are rich, crisp, chewy, and buttery all at the same time. Barquillos use 
	 sweet thin crunchy wafers rolled into tubes that can be sold hollow or filled with polvoron (sweetened and toasted flour mixed with ground nuts).Meringues 
	 are also present in the Philippines, due to the Spanish influence, but they are called merengue – with all the vowels pronounced. Lecheflanis a type of 
	 caramel custard made with eggs and milk similar to the French creme caramel. Leche flan (the local term for the originally Spanish flan de leche, literally 
	 "milk flan"), which is a heavier version of the Spanish flan made with condensed milk and more egg yolks. Leche flan is usually steamed over an open flame 
	 or stove top, although rarely it can also be seen baked. Leche flan is a staple in celebratory feasts.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 A heavier version of leche flan, tocinodelcielo, is similar, but has significantly more egg yolks and sugar.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 The egg pie with a very rich egg custard filling is a mainstay in local bakeries. It is typically baked so that the exposed custard on top is browned. 
	 Bukopie is made with a filling made from young coconut meat and dairy. Mini pastries like turrones de casuy are made up of cashew marzipan wrapped with a 
	 wafer made to resemble a candy wrapper but take on a miniature look of a pie in a size of about a quarter. There is also napoleones – again with all the 
	 vowels pronounced – a mille-feuille pastry stuffed with a sweet milk-based filling.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 There are hard pastries like biskotso a crunchy, sweet, twice-baked bread. Another baked goody is sinipit which is a sweet pastry covered in a crunchy 
	 sugar glaze, made to resemble a length of rope. Similar to sinipit is a snack eaten on roadsides colloquially called shingaling. It is hollow but crunchy 
	 with a salty flavor.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 For a softer treat there is mamon a chiffon-type cake sprinkled with sugar, its name derived from a slang Spanish term for breast. There's also crema de 
	 fruta, which is an elaborate sponge cake topped in succeeding layers of cream, custard, candied fruit, and gelatine. Similar to a sponge cake ismamoncillo 
	 which generally refers to slices taken from a large mamon cake, but it is unrelated to the fruit of the same name. Sandwich pastries likeinipit are made 
	 with two thin layers of chiffon sandwiching a filling of custard that is topped with butter and sugar. Another mamon variant is mamon tostada, basically 
	 mamoncillo toasted to a crunchy texture.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Stuffed pastries of both Western and Eastern influence are common. One can find empanadas, turnover-type pastry filled with a savory-sweet meat filling. 
	 Typically made with ground meat and raisins, it can be deep fried or baked. Siopao is the local version of Chinese baozi. Buchi is another snack probably 
	 of Chinese origin. Bite-sized, buchi is made of deep-fried dough balls (often from rice flour) filled with a sweet mung bean paste, and coated on the 
	 outside with sesame seeds, some variants have ube as the filling. There are also many varieties of the mooncake-like hopia, which come in different shapes 
	 (from a flat, circular stuffed form, to cubes), and have different textures (predominantly using flaky pastry, but sometimes like the ones in mooncakes) 
	 and fillings.
