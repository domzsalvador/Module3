	 During the pre-Hispanic era in the Philippines, the preferred Austronesian methods for food preparation were boiling, steaming and roasting. The 
	 ingredients for common dishes were obtained from locally raised livestock. These ranged from kalabaw (water buffaloes), baka (cows), manok (chickens) and 
	 baboy (pigs) to various kinds of fish and seafood. In 3200 BCE, Austronesians from the southern China Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Taiwan settled in the 
	 region that is now called the Philippines. They brought with them knowledge of rice cultivation and other farming practices which increased the number and
	 variety of edible dish ingredients available for cooking.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Direct trade and cultural exchange with Hokkien China in the Philippines in the Song dynasty (960–1279 BC) with porcelain, ceramics, and silk being traded
	 for spices and trepang in Luzon. This early cultural contact with China introduced a number ofstaple food into Philippine cuisine, most notably toyo 
	 (soy sauce), tokwa; (tofu), toge (bean sprout), and patis (fish sauce), as well as the method of stir frying and making savory soup bases. Many of these 
	 food items and dishes retained their original Hokkien names, such as pancit, and lumpia (jun-pián, lun-pián). The 
	 Chinese foodintroduced during this period were food of the workers and traders, which became a staple of the noodle shops (panciterias), and can be seen 
	 in dishes like arrozcaldo (congee), sinangag (fried rice), chopsuey.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Trade with the various neighboring kingdoms of Malacca and Srivijaya in Malaya and Java brought with it foods and cooking methods which are still commonly
	 used in the Philippines today, such as Bagoong (Malay: Belacan), Patis, Puso (Malay: Ketupat), Rendang, Kare-kare and the infusion of coconut milk in 
	 condiments, such as Laing and GinataangManok (chicken stewed in coconut milk). Through the trade with the Malay-Indonesiankingdoms, cuisine from as far 
	 away as India and Arabia enriched the palettes of the local Austronesians (particularly in the areas of southern Luzon,Mindanao, Sulu, Palawan, the 
	 Visayas and Bicol, where trade was strongest). These foods include various dishes eaten in areas of the southern part of the archipelago today, such as 
	 kurmah, satti and biryani.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Spanish settlers in the 16th century brought with them produce from the Americas like chili peppers, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, and the method ofsautéing 
	 with garlic and onions. Although chili peppers are nowhere as widely used in Filipino cooking compared to much of Southeast Asia, chili leaves are 
	 frequently used as a cooking green, again distinct from the cooking of neighbors. Spanish (and Mexican) dishes were eventually incorporated into 
	 Philippine cuisine with the more complex dishes usually being prepared for special occasions. Some dishes such as arroz a la valenciana remain largely 
	 the same in the Philippine context. Some have been adapted or have come to take on a slightly or significantly different meaning. Arroz a la cubana 
	 served in the Philippines usually includes ground beef picadillo. Philippine longganisa despite its name is more akin to chorizothan Spanish longaniza 
	 (in Visayan regions, it is still known as chorizo). Morcon is likely to refer to a beef roulade dish not the bulbous specialty Spanish sausage.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Today, Philippine cuisine continues to evolve as new techniques, styles of cooking, and ingredients find their way into the country. Traditional dishes both 
	 simple and elaborate, indigenous and foreign-influenced, are seen as are more current popular international viands and fast food fare. However, the Filipino 
	 diet is higher in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than other Asian cuisines.
