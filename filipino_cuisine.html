	 Merienda is taken from the Spanish, and is a light meal or snack especially in the afternoon, similar to the concept of afternoon tea. If the meal is 
	 taken close to dinner, it is called meriendacena, and may be served instead of dinner.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Filipinos have a number of options to take with their traditional kape (coffee): breads and pastries like pandesal, ensaymada (buttery sweet rolls covered 
	 with cheese), hopia (pastries similar to mooncakes filled with sweet bean paste) and empanada (savory pastries stuffed with meat). There's also the option 
	 of cakes made with sticky rice (kakanin) like kutsinta, sapin-sapin, palitaw, biko, suman, bibingka, and pitsi-pitsi.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Savory dishes often eaten during merienda include pancit canton (stir-fried noodles), palabok (rice noodles with a shrimp-based sauce), tokwa'tbaboy(fried 
	 tofu with boiled pork ears in a garlic-flavored soy sauce and vinegar sauce), and dinuguan (a spicy stew made with pork blood) which is often served with 
	 puto (steamed rice flour cakes).
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Dim sum and dumplings, brought over by the Fujianese people, have been given a Filipino touch and are often eaten for merienda. Street food, most of which 
	 are skewered on bamboo sticks, such as squid balls, fish balls and others, are common choices too.
