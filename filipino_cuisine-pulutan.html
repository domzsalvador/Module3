	 Pulutan (from the Filipino word pulutin which literally means "something that is picked up") is a term roughly analogous to the English term "finger food". 
	 Originally, it was a snack accompanied with liquor or beer but has found its way into Philippine cuisine as appetizers or, in some cases, main dishes, as 
	 in the case of sisig.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Deep fried pulutan include chicharrón (also spelled chicharon or tsitsaron), pork rinds that have been salted, dried, then fried; chicharongbituka, pig 
	 intestines that have been deep fried to a crisp; chicharongbulaklak, similar to chicharongbituka it is made from mesenteries of pig intestines and has a 
	 bulaklak or flower appearance; and chicharongmanok, chicken skin that has been deep fried until crisp.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Some grilled foods include barbecue isaw, chicken or pig intestines marinated and skewered; barbecue tenga, pig ears that have been marinated andskewered; 
	 pork barbecue which is skewered pork marinated in a usually sweet blend; betamax, salted solidified pork or chicken blood which is skewered; adidas which 
	 is grilled or sautéed chicken feet. And there is sisig a popular pulutan made from the pig's cheek skin, ears and liver that is initially boiled, then 
	 grilled over charcoal and afterwards minced and cooked with chopped onions, chillies, and spices.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Smaller snacks such as mani (peanuts) are often sold boiled in the shell, salted, spiced or flavored with garlic by street vendors in the Philippines. 
	 Another snack is kropeck, which is fish crackers.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 Fried tokwa'tbaboy is tofu fried with boiled pork then dipped in a garlic-flavored soy sauce or vinegar dip that is also served as a side dish to 
	 pancitluglog or pancitpalabok.
