	 As a tropical oriental country it should come as no surprise there are many treats made from rice and coconuts. One often seen dessert is bibingka, a hot 
	 rice cake optionally topped with a pat of butter, slices of kesongputi (white cheese), itlognamaalat (salted duck eggs), and sometimes grated coconut. 
	 There are also glutinous rice sweets called biko made with sugar, butter, and coconut milk. Another brown rice cake is kutsinta. Puto is another well 
	 known example of sweet steamed rice cakes prepared in many different sizes and colors. Sapin-sapin are three-layered, tri-colored sweets made with rice 
	 flour, purple yam, and coconut milk with its gelatinous appearance. Palitaw are rice patties covered with sesame seeds, sugar, and coconut; pitsi-pitsi 
	 which are cassava patties coated with cheese or coconut; and tibok-tibok is based on carabao milk as a de leche (similar to majablanca). As a snack, 
	 binatog is created with corn kernels with shredded coconut. Packaged snacks wrapped in banana or palm leaves then steamed,suman are made from sticky rice.
	 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 For cold desserts there is halo-halo which can be described as a dessert made with shaved ice, milk, and sugar with additional ingredients like coconut,
	 halaya (mashed purple yam), caramel custard, plantains, jackfruit, red beans, tapioca and pinipig being typical. Other similar treats made with shaved 
	 ice include saba con yelo which is shaved ice served with milk and minatamisnasaging (ripe plantains chopped and caramelized with brown sugar); mais con 
	 yelo which is shaved ice served with steamed corn kernels, sugar, and milk; and bukopandan sweetened grated strips of coconut with gulaman, milk, and the 
	 juice or extract from pandan leaves. Sorbetes (ice cream) is popular too. A local version uses coconut milk instead of cow milk. Ice candy made from juice or 
	 chocolate put it in a freezer to freeze is another treat. It can be any kind of flavor depending on the maker; chocolate and buko (coconut) flavored ice candy 
	 are two of the most popular.
